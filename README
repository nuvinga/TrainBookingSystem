This code has been written as partial complition for my BEng Software Engineering degrees' first year Programming Principles assignment. 
This code allows the a user to create their train trip to an from Badulla, a beautiful city in Sri Lanka.
It allows a user to book a train ticket for a future date and to select the start and end stops of the trip. 
Hope it will help your purpose. Please request me before using this code:)
Thanks, Nuvin.
